Although he brought a phenomenon to the art world, the way in which he teaches his students has aged. While completing colour experiments, Albers encourages the reader to use paper colour chips and cut-outs from magazines.\r\n\r\nAlthough this can still be done, the advancement in technology that was non-existent at his time can be used to explore an even wider range of colour interaction possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this book - like Albers - is to develop through experience, an eye for colour. Putting theory aside, the art of practice takes the forefront and a new way of experiencing colour emerges.","images":"http://2019.ocadu-graphic.design/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/IMG_8985%20copy.jpg?itok=rkCC8_Ia, http://2019.ocadu-graphic.design/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/IMG_8989%20copy.jpg?itok=8OFGsGgu, http://2019.ocadu-graphic.design/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/IMG_8991.jpg?itok=ezPv5UTE, http://2019.ocadu-graphic.design/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/IMG_8993%20copy.jpg?itok=2I_jwCdB","tags":"Book Design","project":"The Modern Interaction of Colour","name":"Hailey Wengle","nid":"222","profile":""}},{"node":{"email":"sara.syme.design@gmail.com","instructor":"frederick","link":"http://symedesign.myportfolio.com","desc":"Annie Leonard\u2019s Story of Stuff inspired my project.

The Canadian government has a monopoly on the seeds that can be legally purchased and grown, resulting in limited selection and by extension, genetic diversity.

They are the ancient language of the universe and the beat to which we dance. While some are tangible, like the elliptical grooves on our fingertips, others are ethereal repetitions in time. Just like the harmonious orbits of celestial bodies as they float through space, many of the routines, systems, and materials that we design for ourselves are synchronized with the rhythms of nature. We go to sleep when the sun sets, we engineer through processes like biomimicry\u2014we even navigate through urban tunnels like beetles burrowing through the hollows of trees. \r\n\r\nIn such a tumultuous time of environmental catastrophe and political unrest, we are in dire need of an empathetic shift towards human and non-human beings alike. Perhaps by recognizing our relationship to nature\u2019s intuitive systems of organization we may be able to solve many structural issues within our society today. Form Follows Nature aims to express the silent language of patterns through the cinematic experience, where form, movement, and sound are intertwined in a symbiosis of time and space. As different patterns emerge and fluctuate against the black void of the screen, we begin to see the universe as a fertile incubator of change and growth to which we are nothing more and nothing less than a soft footprint through cosmic transformation. \r\n\r\nNarrated by the powerful, feminine voice of Sylvia Plath, her poem Mushrooms gives a voice to those inherently voiceless beings. As the organisms grow and multiply softly and quietly, we begin to realize that not all revolutions are loud ones.\r\n\r\nBy bringing a sensory awareness to the beautiful metaphors that exist between nature, humans and artifice, we can begin to propose an openness towards alternative ways of thinking about the human condition. Through this constant reframing of perspectives\u00ad\u2014like the flux, clash, and flow of patterns, we may begin to optimistically direct our gaze away from objective frameworks of knowledge and towards a critical, inclusive, and biocentric future.
